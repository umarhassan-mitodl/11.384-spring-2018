The students in the Practicum will help determine the extent to which these efforts have been successful. They will identify specific projects or policy-making efforts that the following year's cohort of International Visiting Scholars can examine more closely.\u00a0\n\n### Lead Faculty\n\nProfessor Larry Susskind\n\n### Teaching Assistants\n\nJessica Gordon  \nYasmin Zaerpoor\n\n### Administrative Staff\n\nTakeo Kuwabara  \nSelmah Goldberg\n",
